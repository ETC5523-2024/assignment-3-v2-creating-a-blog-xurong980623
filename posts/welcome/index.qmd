# The EV Revolution: What's Happening?
Electric vehicles (EVs) are taking the world by storm, and it's not just about cutting emissions—it's about the future of transportation! But here's the real question: who’s leading the charge in EV adoption, and what types of EVs are people actually buying? Whether you're an industry insider or just curious about where the world is headed, understanding these trends is crucial. In this post, we break down EV sales data from 2010 to 2024,as well as predicted data through 2035, uncovering key insights on regional adoption and the most popular types of EVs.

# The Data: How We Uncovered Global EV Trends

## Data Source: 
To get a comprehensive view of global EV sales, we used data from the [website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patricklford/global-ev-sales-2010-2024/data),tracking sales by region and vehicle type. The dataset includes actual sales data from 2010 to 2024 and forecasted data up to 2035, providing a detailed picture of both historical and predicted trends. To simplify the analysis, we grouped individual countries into broader regions like North America and Europe. Predicted sales were flagged separately for easy distinction.

## Variables in the Dataset
The dataset includes several variables that track EV sales across different regions and vehicle types:

- Year: Year of EV sales.
- Category: Historical vs predicted sales figures.
- Paramater: include 4 categories: EV sales,EV sales share,EV stock,EV stock share.
- Region: Countries where sales occurred.
- Powertrain: Type of electric vehicle (BEV, PHEV, FCEV).
- Value: Number of sales sold in a given year and region.

## Data Cleaning Steps
Before jumping into the analysis, we had to clean up the data. Here’s how:

- **Group by Region**: We combined individual countries into larger regions like North America and Europe to highlight broader trends. (e.g., combining the USA, Canada, and Mexico into "North America").

- **Handling Missing or Invalid Data**: Any missing or inaccurate data was removed to ensure accuracy. Predicted sales data was flagged so we could easily distinguish it from actual historical sales.

- **Standardized Year Format**: The "Year" column was formatted as a numeric variable for better analysis, and later converted back to a categorical format for clear visualizations.

The code below demonstrates these data cleaning steps:
```{r}
#| echo: true  
#| code-fold: true
ev_data <- read_csv("data/IEA Global EV Data 2024.csv")

# Define region groups
region_mapping <- function(region) {
  if (region %in% c("USA", "Canada", "Mexico")) {
    return("North America")
  } else if (region %in% c("Brazil", "Argentina", "Chile", "Colombia", "Peru")) {
    return("South America")
  } else if (region == "China") {
    return("China")
  } else if (region %in% c("UK", "United Kingdom")) {
    return("UK")
  } else if (region %in% c("Germany", "France", "Italy", "Spain", "Netherlands", "Belgium", "Sweden", "Norway", "Finland", "Denmark", "Switzerland", "Austria", "Ireland", "Portugal", "Greece", "Luxembourg", "Poland", "Czech Republic", "Hungary", "Slovakia", "Slovenia")) {
    return("Europe")
  } else if (region %in% c("Australia", "New Zealand")) {
    return("Australia")
  } else if (region %in% c("Bulgaria", "Costa Rica", "Croatia", "Cyprus", "Estonia", "Iceland", "India", "Indonesia", "Israel", "Japan", "Korea", "Latvia", "Lithuania", "Romania", "Seychelles", "South Africa", "Thailand", "Turkiye", "United Arab Emirates")) {
    return("Other")
  } else if (region == "World") {
    return("World")
  } else {
    return(NA)
  }
}

# Apply region groups to the dataset and filter out NAs
ev_data <- ev_data |>
  mutate(Grouped_Region = sapply(region, region_mapping)) |>
  filter(!is.na(Grouped_Region))

# Convert 'year' to numeric for comparison and back to factor for plotting
ev_data <- ev_data |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(as.character(year)))

# Create a summary table of the grouped regions and their countries
grouped_regions_summary <- ev_data |>
  distinct(region, Grouped_Region) |>
  group_by(Grouped_Region) |>
  summarize(Countries = paste(unique(region), collapse = ", ")) |>
  ungroup()
```
After completing these steps, we ensured that the dataset was ready for further analysis, making it easier to observe key patterns in EV sales and regional trends. This data cleaning process not only improved the accuracy of the analysis but also made the visualizations much clearer and easier to interpret.

```

## The Dominance of BEVs
When we look at global EV sales by powertrain type, it’s clear that Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are the favorite. BEVs account for a whopping 81.3% of all EV sales worldwide, while Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) make up 17.9%, and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) are at a distant 0.8%.
```{r}
#| label: fig-barchart
#| fig-cap: Worldwide Distribution of EV Sales by Powertrain Type
# Prepare data for the chart
ev_sales_world_data <- ev_data |>
  filter(parameter == "EV sales") |>
  group_by(powertrain) |>
  summarize(total_sales = sum(value)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  mutate(percentage = total_sales / sum(total_sales) * 100)  # Compute percentage

# Reorder powertrain factor based on total_sales in descending order
ev_sales_world_data <- ev_sales_world_data |>
  mutate(powertrain = fct_reorder(powertrain, total_sales, .desc = TRUE))

# Create a bar chart for EV sales distribution by powertrain type
ev_sales_bar_chart <- ggplot(ev_sales_world_data, aes(x = powertrain, y = total_sales, fill = powertrain)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +  # Use geom_bar for a bar chart
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +  # Set color palette
  labs(title = "Worldwide Distribution of EV Sales by Powertrain Type",
       x = "Powertrain Type",
       y = "Total Sales") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), "%")),  # Add labels with percentages
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 5) +  # Adjust label position and size
  theme_minimal()  # Use a minimal theme for a clean look

# Plot the bar chart
print(ev_sales_bar_chart)
```
@fig-barchart shows that shows that BEVs are the most popular choice across the globe. The strong market preference for BEVs is driven by improvements in battery technology, lower costs, and better range.

## Regional Differences in Powertrain Preferences
Although BEVs dominate globally, regional preferences vary. @fig-stackbarchart shows the EV sales share by region and powertrain type. For example, PHEVs have a larger presence in Europe and South America compared to other regions, while FCEVs struggle to gain traction anywhere.It also highlights how different regions favor different types of EVs. China and North America have an overwhelming preference for BEVs, while Europe and South America also show interest in PHEVs.
```{r}
#| label: fig-stackbarchart
#| fig-cap: EV Sales Share by Grouped Region and Powertrain
# Prepare the dataset by grouping and summarizing the data
ev_sales_share_data <- ev_data |>
  filter(parameter == "EV sales",Grouped_Region != "World") |>  # Filter for EV sales data
  group_by(Grouped_Region, powertrain) |>  # Group by region and powertrain type
  summarize(total_sales = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) |>  # Calculate total sales for each combination
  ungroup() |>
  group_by(Grouped_Region) |>  # Regroup by region to calculate share within each region
  mutate(sales_share = total_sales / sum(total_sales) * 100) |>  # Calculate sales share as a percentage
  ungroup()

# Reorder regions and powertrain factors for better visualization
ev_sales_share_data <- ev_sales_share_data |>
  mutate(Grouped_Region = fct_reorder(Grouped_Region, -sales_share),  # Reorder regions based on sales share
         powertrain = fct_reorder(powertrain, sales_share, .desc = TRUE))  # Reorder powertrain types

# Create a bar chart to visualize the sales share by grouped region and powertrain
ev_sales_share_plot <- ggplot(ev_sales_share_data, aes(x = Grouped_Region, y = sales_share, fill = powertrain)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +  # Use dodge position to place bars side by side
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +  # Set color palette
  labs(title = "EV Sales Share by Grouped Region and Powertrain",
       x = "Grouped Region",
       y = "EV Sales Share (%)") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +  # Formatting y-axis as percentage
  theme_minimal() +  # Use a minimal theme for a clean look
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis text for better readability

# Plot the bar chart
print(ev_sales_share_plot)

```
