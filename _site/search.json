Here’s how:\n\nGroup by Region: We combined individual countries into larger regions like North America and Europe to highlight broader trends. (e.g., combining the USA, Canada, and Mexico into “North America”).\nHandling Missing or Invalid Data: Any missing or inaccurate data was removed to ensure accuracy. Predicted sales data was flagged so we could easily distinguish it from actual historical sales.\nStandardized Year Format: The “Year” column was formatted as a numeric variable for better analysis, and later converted back to a categorical format for clear visualizations.\n\nThe code below demonstrates these data cleaning steps:\n\n\nCode\nev_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/IEA Global EV Data 2024.csv\")\n\n# Define region groups\nregion_mapping &lt;- function(region) {\n  if (region %in% c(\"USA\", \"Canada\", \"Mexico\")) {\n    return(\"North America\")\n  } else if (region %in% c(\"Brazil\", \"Argentina\", \"Chile\", \"Colombia\", \"Peru\")) {\n    return(\"South America\")\n  } else if (region == \"China\") {\n    return(\"China\")\n  } else if (region %in% c(\"UK\", \"United Kingdom\")) {\n    return(\"UK\")\n  } else if (region %in% c(\"Germany\", \"France\", \"Italy\", \"Spain\", \"Netherlands\", \"Belgium\", \"Sweden\", \"Norway\", \"Finland\", \"Denmark\", \"Switzerland\", \"Austria\", \"Ireland\", \"Portugal\", \"Greece\", \"Luxembourg\", \"Poland\", \"Czech Republic\", \"Hungary\", \"Slovakia\", \"Slovenia\")) {\n    return(\"Europe\")\n  } else if (region %in% c(\"Australia\", \"New Zealand\")) {\n    return(\"Australia\")\n  } else if (region %in% c(\"Bulgaria\", \"Costa Rica\", \"Croatia\", \"Cyprus\", \"Estonia\", \"Iceland\", \"India\", \"Indonesia\", \"Israel\", \"Japan\", \"Korea\", \"Latvia\", \"Lithuania\", \"Romania\", \"Seychelles\", \"South Africa\", \"Thailand\", \"Turkiye\", \"United Arab Emirates\")) {\n    return(\"Other\")\n  } else if (region == \"World\") {\n    return(\"World\")\n  } else {\n    return(NA)\n  }\n}\n\n# Apply region groups to the dataset and filter out NAs\nev_data &lt;- ev_data |&gt;\n  mutate(Grouped_Region = sapply(region, region_mapping)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(Grouped_Region))\n\n# Convert 'year' to numeric for comparison and back to factor for plotting\nev_data &lt;- ev_data |&gt;\n  mutate(year = as.numeric(as.character(year)))\n\n# Create a summary table of the grouped regions and their countries\ngrouped_regions_summary &lt;- ev_data |&gt;\n  distinct(region, Grouped_Region) |&gt;\n  group_by(Grouped_Region) |&gt;\n  summarize(Countries = paste(unique(region), collapse = \", \")) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\nAfter completing these steps, we ensured that the dataset was ready for further analysis, making it easier to observe key patterns in EV sales and regional trends. This data cleaning process not only improved the accuracy of the analysis but also made the visualizations much clearer and easier to interpret."
