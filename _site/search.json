China has consistently led the market, followed by North America and Europe. This growth is primarily driven by government incentives, advancements in EV technology, and increased environmental awareness among consumers.\n\n\nWorldwide Distribution of EV Sales by Powertrain Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Worldwide Distribution of EV Sales by Powertrain Type\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows that BEVs account for 81.3% of global EV sales, followed by PHEVs at 17.9%, and FCEVs at 0.8%. This distribution indicates a strong market inclination towards battery-powered vehicles, likely due to improvements in battery technology, range, and cost reductions.\n\n\nEV Sales Share by Grouped Region and Powertrain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: EV Sales Share by Grouped Region and Powertrain\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows that Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) dominate the EV market across all regions, with particularly high shares in China, North America, and Australia.Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) have a significant presence in Europe, UK and South America.Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) have a minimal market share globally, indicating limited adoption. Overall, the preference for BEVs is strong worldwide, though regional variations in powertrain preferences are evident."
