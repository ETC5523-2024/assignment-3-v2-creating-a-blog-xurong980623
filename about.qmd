## Hi, I'm Rong Xu

Iâ€™m a passionate data explorer and currently pursuing my degree in **Business Analytics** at Monash University. My focus is on using data to solve complex real-world problems, especially in the fields of finance, nature, the healthcare industry. I have interest and some experience in:

- **R programming** and data wrangling
- **Time series analysis** and forecasting
- **Data visualization** with ggplot2 and interactive dashboards

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, reading, and explore the nature. Feel free to check out my projects on GitHub or connect with me on LinkedIn.
