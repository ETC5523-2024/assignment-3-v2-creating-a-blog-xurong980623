But here's the real question: who’s leading the charge in EV adoption, and what types of EVs are people actually buying? Whether you're an industry insider or just curious about where the world is headed, understanding these trends is crucial. In this post, we break down EV sales data from 2010 to 2024,as well as predicted data through 2035, uncovering key insights on regional adoption and the most popular types of EVs.\n\n# The Data: How We Uncovered Global EV Trends\n\n## Data Source: \nTo get a comprehensive view of global EV sales, we used data from the [website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patricklford/global-ev-sales-2010-2024/data),tracking sales by region and vehicle type. The dataset includes actual sales data from 2010 to 2024 and forecasted data up to 2035, providing a detailed picture of both historical and predicted trends. To simplify the analysis, we grouped individual countries into broader regions like North America and Europe. Predicted sales were flagged separately for easy distinction.\n\n## Variables in the Dataset\nThe dataset includes several variables that track EV sales across different regions and vehicle types:\n\n- Year: Year of EV sales.\n- Category: Historical vs predicted sales figures.\n- Paramater: include 4 categories: EV sales,EV sales share,EV stock,EV stock share.\n- Region: Countries where sales occurred.\n- Powertrain: Type of electric vehicle (BEV, PHEV, FCEV).\n- Value: Number of sales sold in a given year and region.\n\n## Data Cleaning Steps\nBefore jumping into the analysis, we had to clean up the data. Here’s how:\n\n- **Group by Region**: We combined individual countries into larger regions like North America and Europe to highlight broader trends. (e.g., combining the USA, Canada, and Mexico into \"North America\").\n\n- **Handling Missing or Invalid Data**: Any missing or inaccurate data was removed to ensure accuracy. Predicted sales data was flagged so we could easily distinguish it from actual historical sales.\n\n- **Standardized Year Format**: The \"Year\" column was formatted as a numeric variable for better analysis, and later converted back to a categorical format for clear visualizations.\n\nThe code below demonstrates these data cleaning steps:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nev_data <- read_csv(\"data/IEA Global EV Data 2024.csv\")\n\n# Define region groups\nregion_mapping <- function(region) {\n  if (region %in% c(\"USA\", \"Canada\", \"Mexico\")) {\n    return(\"North America\")\n  } else if (region %in% c(\"Brazil\", \"Argentina\", \"Chile\", \"Colombia\", \"Peru\")) {\n    return(\"South America\")\n  } else if (region == \"China\") {\n    return(\"China\")\n  } else if (region %in% c(\"UK\", \"United Kingdom\")) {\n    return(\"UK\")\n  } else if (region %in% c(\"Germany\", \"France\", \"Italy\", \"Spain\", \"Netherlands\", \"Belgium\", \"Sweden\", \"Norway\", \"Finland\", \"Denmark\", \"Switzerland\", \"Austria\", \"Ireland\", \"Portugal\", \"Greece\", \"Luxembourg\", \"Poland\", \"Czech Republic\", \"Hungary\", \"Slovakia\", \"Slovenia\")) {\n    return(\"Europe\")\n  } else if (region %in% c(\"Australia\", \"New Zealand\")) {\n    return(\"Australia\")\n  } else if (region %in% c(\"Bulgaria\", \"Costa Rica\", \"Croatia\", \"Cyprus\", \"Estonia\", \"Iceland\", \"India\", \"Indonesia\", \"Israel\", \"Japan\", \"Korea\", \"Latvia\", \"Lithuania\", \"Romania\", \"Seychelles\", \"South Africa\", \"Thailand\", \"Turkiye\", \"United Arab Emirates\")) {\n    return(\"Other\")\n  } else if (region == \"World\") {\n    return(\"World\")\n  } else {\n    return(NA)\n  }\n}\n\n# Apply region groups to the dataset and filter out NAs\nev_data <- ev_data |>\n  mutate(Grouped_Region = sapply(region, region_mapping)) |>\n  filter(!is.na(Grouped_Region))\n\n# Convert 'year' to numeric for comparison and back to factor for plotting\nev_data <- ev_data |>\n  mutate(year = as.numeric(as.character(year)))\n\n# Create a summary table of the grouped regions and their countries\ngrouped_regions_summary <- ev_data |>\n  distinct(region, Grouped_Region) |>\n  group_by(Grouped_Region) |>\n  summarize(Countries = paste(unique(region), collapse = \", \")) |>\n  ungroup()\n```\n:::\n\nAfter completing these steps, we ensured that the dataset was ready for further analysis, making it easier to observe key patterns in EV sales and regional trends. This data cleaning process not only improved the accuracy of the analysis but also made the visualizations much clearer and easier to interpret.\n\n# What the Data Tells Us: EV Sales by Region\n\n## EV Sales Have Soared Since 2010\nThis stacked bar chart @fig-stack-barchart illustrates how different regions are contributing to the global rise of EVs.It also shows the rise of EV sales globally from 2010 to 2024, with predictions through 2035. The data highlights a significant increase in EV sales since 2018, driven largely by growing government incentives and technological advancements.The reduced opacity in the chart represents predicted sales, showing that this trend is expected to continue upward for the next decade.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![EV Sales Over Time by Grouped Region](index_files/figure-html/fig-stack-barchart-1.png){#fig-stack-barchart width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\nThis table @tbl-marketsharetable clearly shows the market share of EV sales by region respectively.

BEVs account for a whopping 81.3% of all EV sales worldwide, while Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) make up 17.9%, and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) are at a distant 0.8%.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Worldwide Distribution of EV Sales by Powertrain Type](index_files/figure-html/fig-barchart-1.png){#fig-barchart width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n@fig-barchart shows that shows that BEVs are the most popular choice across the globe. The strong market preference for BEVs is driven by improvements in battery technology, lower costs, and better range.\n\n## Regional Differences in Powertrain Preferences\nAlthough BEVs dominate globally, regional preferences vary. @fig-stackbarchart shows the EV sales share by region and powertrain type. For example, PHEVs have a larger presence in Europe and South America compared to other regions, while FCEVs struggle to gain traction anywhere.It also highlights how different regions favor different types of EVs. China and North America have an overwhelming preference for BEVs, while Europe and South America also show interest in PHEVs.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![EV Sales Share by Grouped Region and Powertrain](index_files/figure-html/fig-stackbarchart-1.png){#fig-stackbarchart width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Wrapping Up: The Future of EVs Looks Bright\nThis analysis explored the global growth of EV sales from 2010 to 2024, as well as predicted data through 2035. It provided insights into how different regions and powertrain types contribute to the rapidly evolving EV market. The data paints a clear picture: EV adoption is growing rapidly across the world, with BEVs leading the way. Since 2018, sales have skyrocketed, particularly in China, North America, and Europe, and this growth is expected to continue well into the 2030s.\nKey Takeaways:\n\n- **EV Sales Growth**: The global EV market has seen rapid growth, especially since 2018, thanks to technological advancements and government support.\n\n- **Powertrain Preferences**: BEVs dominate the market, while PHEVs hold a notable share in specific regions like South America and Europe, and FCEVs have limited presence.\n\n- **Regional Leadership**: China, North America, and Europe are leading the charge, each with distinct preferences for EV types.\n\nAs EVs continue to gain traction, understanding these trends will be crucial for policymakers, businesses, and consumers alike. The future of transportation is electric, and it’s only getting brighter.\n\n# Reference\n1.Grigoroudis, E., & Karkazis, S. (2020).
