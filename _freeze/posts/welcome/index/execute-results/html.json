Welcome!\n\n![](thumbnail.jpg)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Part A\n\n## Executive Summary{#sec-summary}\nThe report analyzes the rapid growth and regional dynamics of the global Electric Vehicles(EV) market from 2010 to 2024. China's leadership, the dominance of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), the significant growth in North America and the different region preferences of adoptions are key trends.These insights are critical for stakeholders in the automotive and energy sectors to understand and leverage the ongoing shifts in the EV market.\n\n## Introduction to the Problem{#sec-introduction}\nElectric vehicles are increasingly considered a viable solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. Understanding the trends in global EV sales, including which regions and powertrains are leading the market, can provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the automotive and energy sectors. This report analyzes data from 2010 to 2024 to identify key patterns, regional leaders, and the primary drivers behind the adoption of electric vehicles globally.\n\n## Key Results{#sec-results}\n\n### EV Sales Over Time by Grouped Region\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![EV Sales Over Time by Grouped Region](index_files/figure-html/fig-stack-barchart-1.png){#fig-stack-barchart width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom @fig-stack-barchart, we can find that the sales of EVs have shown a substantial increase globally since 2010, with a sharp uptick starting around 2018. China has consistently led the market, followed by North America and Europe. This growth is primarily driven by government incentives, advancements in EV technology, and increased environmental awareness among consumers.\n\n### Worldwide Distribution of EV Sales by Powertrain Type\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Worldwide Distribution of EV Sales by Powertrain Type](index_files/figure-html/fig-barchart-1.png){#fig-barchart width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n@fig-barchart shows that BEVs account for 81.3% of global EV sales, followed by PHEVs at 17.9%, and FCEVs at 0.8%. This distribution indicates a strong market inclination towards battery-powered vehicles, likely due to improvements in battery technology, range, and cost reductions.\n\n### EV Sales Share by Grouped Region and Powertrain\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![EV Sales Share by Grouped Region and Powertrain](index_files/figure-html/fig-stackbarchart-1.png){#fig-stackbarchart width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n@fig-stackbarchart shows that Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) dominate the EV market across all regions, with particularly high shares in China, North America, and Australia.Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) have a significant presence in Europe, UK and South America.Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) have a minimal market share globally, indicating limited adoption. Overall, the preference for BEVs is strong worldwide, though regional variations in powertrain preferences are evident.\n\n## Brief Methods\n\n### Data Source: \nThe data used for this analysis is sourced from [website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patricklford/global-ev-sales-2010-2024/data).This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of EV sales across different regions,powertrains and time periods.I custom region grouping that aggregates countries into broader regions for clearer analysis.Further more,in the stacked bar chart below, future sales data is flagged as \"Predicted\" and displayed with reduced opacity, highlighting the distinction between historical and forecasted data.\n\n### Data Dictionary:\n- Year: Year of EV sales.\n- Category: Historical vs predicted sales figures.\n- Paramater: include 4 categories: EV sales,EV sales share,EV stock,EV stock share.\n- Region: Countries where sales occurred.\n- Powertrain: Type of electric vehicle (BEV, PHEV, FCEV).\n- Value: Number of sales sold in a given year and region.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe above analysis involved a comprehensive review of EV sales data from 2010 to 2024 as well as the some of the predicted data from 2024 to 2035 focusing on trends over time, regional distribution, and powertrain types. \n\n### Key findings{#sec-findings}\n \n- Sales Growth: There has been a significant increase in global EV sales, particularly since 2018, driven by advancements in technology and government incentives.\n\n- Powertrain Preferences: BEVs dominate the market, while PHEVs hold a notable share in specific regions like South America and Europe, and FCEVs have limited presence.\n\n- Regional Leadership: China, North America, and Europe are leading the charge in EV adoption, each exhibiting unique trends and preferences.\n\n### Further improvements\nFor further improvements, more granular data on different vehicle models and manufacturers could be included to provide deeper insights into market dynamics.\nMove over,more detailed long-term forecasts could be included to enhance understanding of future market trends.Last but not least, data on consumer preferences and behavior could be incorporated to provide additional context for the observed trends and market shares.\n\n## Reference\n1.Grigoroudis, E., & Karkazis, S.
